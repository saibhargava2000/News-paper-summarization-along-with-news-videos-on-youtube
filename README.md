# News-paper-summarization-along-with-news-videos-on-youtube

Abstract: 

As online news consumption continues shifting towards video platforms, viewers face rising challenges in distilling key details from lengthy transcripts. This project aims to enhance the news digestion experience by utilizing recent advances in natural language processing to automatically generate concise summaries of YouTube news videos.
At the core, two neural sequence-to-sequence models are employed - BART and T5 - for their proficiency on text summarization tasks. Both incorporate encoder-decoder architectures, interpreting input sequences and predicting condensed summaries reflecting salient information. However, BART uniquely combines bidirectional context modeling enabling richer understanding compared to conventional left-to-right approaches. Meanwhile, T5 maintains a consistent text-in to text-out framework making adapting between datasets and tasks more seamless. The models are trained on an amalgamated dataset blending YouTube transcripts and the CNN/DailyMail corpus. This multi-source input aids model resilience to linguistic variances in topics and styles. Summarization quality is evaluated via the widely adopted ROUGE metric which quantifies overlap with ground truth summaries across factors like word choice and order. For ease-of-use, a Flask web application allows users to simply submit a YouTube link and view a machine-generated summary of the key details. In summary, by producing readable abridgements from voluminous transcripts, this project aims to empower viewers to efficiently extract valuable information from online video news based on their interests and time constraints.
